**An argument for the benefit of tools and extensions for software developers**

In today's world of programming languages, a language generally falls more or less into one of the two categories:

  a) It's statically typed, meaning that all constants and or variables for a program written in said language should be described with a data type, which is usually enforced by the compiler. An example of strongly typed language is C#, or Java. C++ 
  b) It is dynamically typed, meaning all types are determined during runtime, leading errors occuring usually during program execution. Examples of dynamically typed languages are Javascript and PHP. 
  
  There are languages like C++ which are very hard to categories due to the intrinsic features especially prevalent in later versions.
